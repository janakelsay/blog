# from a dream

Created: November 29, 2022 1:03 PM

I approach the house, glowing gold in the setting sun. There is bustling activity pouring out and buzzing within. The house has a number of spectacularly large windows, and in them I can see my friends. My body has begun to carry me in without me being aware of it, as if I am floating downstream.

I arrive on the porch, immediately commotion erupts around me. My friends, dressed in purple and gold, wearing festive paint on their faces, shining their eyes and brilliant smiles at me, take me by my hands and lead me into the house. They make various exclamations on top of each other and all at once:

“…so happy to see you!”

“…I couldn’t believe it, left all alone…

“…how are you?”

“…thought I would never see you again…”

“…we’ll get you some food, but maybe you need rest…”

I make no objections to their leading, and I make no attempts to answer their questions or acknowledge their comments. I have great difficulty isolating my senses. The house smells of marinating spices and meats, baked bread, and an incense I am very familiar with. It is more brightly lit than any environment I have been in for many days.

For a brief moment, while all this activity happens around me and my every need is attended to, my friends conversing and laughing in jubilation, a great meal beginning to reach its preparedness, I intuit a sense of belonging. It is met with intense emotion, which I welcome. Each cell in my body feels as though in that moment it is flooded with mercy. My knees waver in their support. I blink rapidly at the tears that form in my eyes. I let myself believe for that moment that all I have suffered has not been in vain. I breathe in this sense deeply. Finally, the one who is leading me stops before a door beyond the kitchen and social commotion, out of sight and sound.

In this corridor, it is darker and quieter. The abrupt change commands my focus. I realize it is Dante, my counselor, who has been leading me. He stands before me now; I notice his eyes are on mine, waiting for me to take notice. He is robed in dark blue, a rich color. He has life in his eyes, which I internally give thanks for. I imagine we are each vocalizing silent prayers of thanks. Dante releases his breath and my arm and whispers, “He is waiting here for you. Would you like to see him now? He is very eager to know you are safe.”

“Can I see him? Am I capable? I’m afraid my journey isn’t complete.” I twist the ends of a ruby red robe which was hung on my back on my arrival to the house.

Dante impatiently interjects, “Please, be assured. You have done well. This is the end.” He reaches for the iron handle of the door, and pushes it open, revealing darkness within, interspersed with candlelight.

With all my strength, I step inside the door. It is shut behind me without a sound. Before I see him, I feel him at my side. I can feel how he has desperately waited for my arrival, and for the first time since I have found myself safely at home, I smile.

“Have you been very impatient?”

The confirmation of my voice as evidence of my presence in his room calls his body to respond before his voice catches up. His arms are around me and holding fast. We choke on our tears as we discover one another again. His hands explore my face, my back, my hands, my neck, and he breathes, letting out one utterance after another, softly, “I missed you, my love, I love you, you’re here, my love.” I hold him tightly, willing my mind to silence, my senses to feel what I have longed for so many nights, now attached to me. I imagine our lives proceed into the future together again, as one.

“Are you pleased?” asks my shaking voice.

He allows his hands to come to rest on my shoulders and looks into my face, deeply and with the only sort of compassion that can come from a close partner, a lover; it is a knowing look.

He says, “I can breathe.”
